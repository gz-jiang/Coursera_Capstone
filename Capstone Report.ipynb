It is a city I loved, but also a city which is rainy. In those past days, every time I found it was raining outside the window when I got up in the morning, I would realise how inconvenience a rainy day would caused. Luckily, I was just a student and the weather would not trouble me a lot; but it is also very obvious that it could trouble almost all the drivers on the road. As an imortant city, the transport problem might be serious in some time. It is just an example to show the complexity of the causes of an accident. In the whole country, with more complicated situation, the analyse might be more difficult and more serious. This is the reason why I chose this field as the main topic of my capstone project. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### DATA\n\nI decided to use the situation in past three years to finish this project. \n\nTo discover the relationship between rainfall and probability of car asscident, the most important data I have to collect all the car accident happened in this period. What's more,  we also should notice the diffierent influence to diffierent car's models. Finally, the accident severity (including human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact) should be considered, too. \n\nThe dataset could be found on https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data?. I chose five factors from it, which are: \n\n1. Light Conditions\n2. Casualty Severity\n3. Road Class\n4. Vehicle Manoeuvre\n5. Vehicle Type\n\nHowever, there are lots of other factors which might influence the accidents, too. They are also included in the dataset I found, but might not the analysis of these factors will not occupy the main space of this report."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
